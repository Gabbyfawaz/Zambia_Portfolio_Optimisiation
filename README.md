Portfolio Optimisation Project

**Overview**

This project applies portfolio optimisation techniques with a focus on Zambian financial data and global assets. It uses Monte Carlo simulation and Sharpe ratio optimisation to identify efficient portfolios. The code is available both as a Python script (personal.py) and a Jupyter Notebook (personal_project.ipynb).

**Usage**

Run Python script:
python personal.py

Run Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook personal_project.ipynb

**Example Output**

Scatter plot of simulated portfolios with risk vs. return.
Highlighted portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.
Optimized weights, expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
